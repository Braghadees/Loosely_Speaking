# Overview

# Things to ponder
* We have a work and it has a dependency over another person.
  We wait for the person to complete. OR We cover the dependency to continue the work.
  We have to make sure this doesn't become a habit.
  **ALTERNATIVELY**
  We will be waiting with the belief it will come to us.
* We want to complete a work and we believe its not our responsibility currently as we have other responsibility.
